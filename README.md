## Description

A school assignment about algorithmic resolution of the famous Knapsack problem.  
Based on 3 methods :  
- "Glouton" : easiest to understand and to implement, but the less efficient.
- Dynamic : use of dynamic programmation which gives a precise result of the problem.
- Branch and bound : Use tree structure and recursive calls to resolve the problem.
